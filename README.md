#kottans-frontend
This is a repository for studying and developing my skills with kottans).
I'm really glad to finally start practi—Åing and hope to get a lot of new great experience.
I will do my best. Also, I need to write something about learned materials. It's really exciting, there is a lot of well-known information for me, but it not bad to repeat it sometimes and as a newcomer, I hope to use it as frequently as I can.
